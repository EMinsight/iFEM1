This repository contains in interactive introduction to the Finite Element Method
---

The course consists of jupyter-notebooks teaching the theory behind the
finite element method. It uses the Python interface to the NGSolve Finite Element
library to let the readers experiment with various methods.

If you want to try it out without installing the NGSolve library on you computer you
can launch the course on binder by clicking on the 'launch binder' logo:

The first time launching iFEM may take a few minutes. When it's ready,
you can work through the tutorials pressing "shift-enter"

This interactive lecture material got possible by the embedded
webgui-visualization developed by M. Hochsteger in home-office.

Note: this material has nothing to do with the excellent matlab finite element package iFEM by Long Chen
